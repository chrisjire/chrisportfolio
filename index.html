         <p>  When people thinks of the word "supercar" or "hypercars" certain preconcieve notions pop up in our minds,for some they are a sign of success, for others it's a display of ostentatious wealth. But to a select few the are like pieces of art that just happen to have wheels on them unlike a Van gogh or a michelangelo, i happen to be one of those people. A normal conventional car is bilt to take from point a to b, but a hypercar is built so as to let you imagination go wild.Hence why they cost a fortune to buy and maintain.

            Three of the most coveted, fastest and rarest hypercars in the world right now are the Mclaren P1, Porsche 918 spyder and The mezmerizing Ferari la Ferari</p>
